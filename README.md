## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- WindiCSS [Grid + Flexbox]
- Mobile-first workflow
- Svelte [Transition API] + TypeScript
- Malachite UI [Accordion | Popover | Tabs]
- Vite

### What I learned

After doing some HTML Validation I learnt that header tags cannot be a descendant of footer tags! So I had to do a quick fix for that.

### Useful resources

- [How to Do an Email Validation in JavaScript?](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/javascript-tutorial/email-validation-in-javascript) - This helped me with the client-side email validation, I only used the RegEX.
